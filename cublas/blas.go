/*
Package cublas - Blas functions for cuda gpus.
Despite Not wanting to make this.
I think I am going to make it for fully connect neural networks.
Someone in the nvidia forums said there was a significant boost to speed when doing fully connected.
That being said cublas has disapeared from my include folder.
The headless machine I am programming on is being weird. So, I will be moving to a new headless server.
