# GoCudnn
Go Bindings for cudnn


Sad to say, but this is going to be a save location for the time being.  I will update here on what is working and not. 

Good News! test in the folder /tests/testmain/ now work!

I will continue to build.  I also wanted to make this about as close to how cudnn would normally work in C.  

I added the use of methods, and the use of multiple returns!

I didn't really want to make too much of a new structs, because the tools were already there. 
I just made some stuff to interface with go a little bit easier.  More to come. with more of a readme.
