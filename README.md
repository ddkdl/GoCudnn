Go Bindings for cudnn


Sad to say, but this is going to be a save location for the time being.  I will update here on what is working and not. 

in tests/testmain/maintestarea.go - the returned ConvolutionFwdAlgoPerformance struct is returning a status of CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. This has to be debugged. I'll continue to comb through this.
